# Review of [The History Learning Site](http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/)
## by Tristan


## What does the URL tell you?
This is a personal site done is memorium of Chris Trueman a historian interested in learning and education.

## What's the Subject Matter?
- The website focuses on creating containers of history, mainly relating to military and political history.

## Is it trustworthy?
- Sources are documented at the the top of the page and amily consist of the original website creators research.
- Links are not provided to the source documents.
- There does not appear to be any signs of plagerism.

## Does Web Publication _enhance_ the storytelling?
- The website is clearly layed out into time periods or events that can be furthur explored. It allows for the easy viewing and searching for information.
- The site manintains linear organization within each of the event titles that allow for a simple narrative.
- I think simply continuing to exapnd upon what is covered, perhaps exapnding what type of histry is covered and creating different classification for what type of history is represented.

## Reccomendation
In terms of ease of use I would definitely suggest this website, it is clear and easy navgatible and would be a quick access ressrouce for these events, the sources are limited to the authors own research and therefore for acdemic purposes would require furthur sources to be useful.
